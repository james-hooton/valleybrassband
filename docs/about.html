        <h3>Who are we?</h3>

        <p>Valley Brass Band is situated in the historic former Richard Evans School building on West End Road, Haydock, St. Helens. We are a 2nd section band and perform regionally and nationally in competitions, in addition to performing for events and special occasions within our local community. We aim to encourage musical interest and develop talent in all age groups and abilities; providing professional and patient tuition to both beginners and experienced players alike. Furthermore, our designated band room and community centre provides a space for our groups to assemble weekly in a friendly and enjoyable environment.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/therichardevanscommunitycentre">Our centre</a> includes a games room complete with pool and table tennis tables, a social area for tea and coffee, and an outdoor playground with a multi-use sports cage and outdoor games.</p>

            <h4>Learners Group</h4>

            <p>It is never too early to start. We have an enthusiastic group of young learners ranging from primary school to high school, and are always welcoming new players to give it a go. Starting from the very basics of playing a single note, gradually improving through tuition to performing as a group in our community concerts, our learner group provides an exciting opportunity for any child to learn a new skill and socialise with likeminded children.</p>
